## Learning Outcomes

### Chapter 1: Systems of Linear Equations (LE)
**LE 1**. Translate back and forth between a system of linear equations, a vector equation, and the corresponding augmented matrix.
**LE 2**. Explain why a matrix isn’t in reduced row echelon form, and put a matrix in reduced row echelon form.
**LE 3**. Determine the number of solutions for a system of linear equations or a vector equation.
**LE 4**. Compute the solution set for a system of linear equations or a vector equation with infinitly many solutions.

### Chapter 2: Euclidean Vectors (EV)
**EV 1** Determine if a Euclidean vector can be written as a linear combination of a given set of Euclidean vectors by solving an appropriate vector equation.

**EV 2** Determine if a set of Euclidean vectors spans by solving appropriate vector equations.

(skip **EV3**)

**EV 4** Determine if a set of Euclidean vectors is linearly dependent or independent by solving an appropriate vector equation.

**EV 5** Explain why a set of Euclidean vectors is or is not a basis of .

**EV 6** Compute a basis for the subspace spanned by a given set of Euclidean vectors, and determine the dimension of the subspace.

### Chapter 3 Algebraic Properties of Maps (AT)
**AT 1**. Determine if a map between vector spaces of polynomials is linear or not.
**AT 2**. Translate back and forth between a linear transformation of Euclidean
spaces and its standard matrix, and perform related computations.

**AT 4** Determine if a given linear map is injective and/or surjective.

    - Lots of worked examples, and answers to all exercises. 

- Nicholson. *Linear Algebra with Applications*.
    - A traditionally formatted textbook

- Margalit, Dan and Rabinoff, Joe. *Intereactive Linear Algebra*
    - Nice interactive web interface for 3D plots 
    - https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/
    - very concise

## Assignments/Grading

Each learning outcome worksheet is worth 5 points total. I will do a version of each worksheet in class, but you must do another version. 

The **website gives answers to all the questions** (that is in part on reason I chose it), but you **must** give explanations or justification. **Submissions that have answers without appropriate justification will receive zero points**.
|               | Points  |
| -------------: | ------ |
| Chapter 1 Learning Outcomes (4) | 20  |
| Chapter 2 Learning Outcomes (6) | 30  |
| Chapter 3 Learning Outcomes (6) | 30 |
| Chapter 4 Learning Outcomes (4) | 20 |
| Chapter 5 Learning Outcomes (4) | 20 |
| Midterm Exam | 10|
| Final Exam |  10 | 
| **Total**| 140 |


For various reasons, I have abandoned giving timed written exams, for better or worse. 

## Late work policy
I don't accept any late work. See Brightspace for exact deadlines, but they are generally a week after a learning outcome worksheet being assigned.




## Academic Integrity

**For your own benefit, please do each assignment mostly on your own**. I do a version of each one in class for you, so this really is not asking much. It is ok to ask for help on occasion if you are stuck. **But definitely do not copy work from someone/somewhere else**.  I reserve the right to ask you to meet with me over Zoom and explain your answers at any time. If you cannot explain your answers, I reserve the right to give you an F for the course.

The college's policy on academic integrity also applies to this course
https://www.oldwestbury.edu/policies/academicresearch/policy-academic-integrity
Here are some excerpts from that policy:

>As members of the Old Westbury community, students are expected to adhere to standards of honesty and ethical behavior. Plagiarism and other types of academic dishonesty are condemned at all academic institutions. These acts detract from the student’s intellectual and personal growth by undermining the processes of higher learning and the struggle with one’s own expression of ideas and information.  Good academic procedure requires giving proper credit when using the words or ideas of others.

>Plagiarizing means “presenting somebody else’s words or ideas without acknowledging where those words and ideas come from” (Ann Raimes, Keys for Writers, 7th ed., p.135).  Examples include:
>-   copying material from the Internet or other sources and presenting it as one’s own
>-    using any author’s words without quotation marks; using any quotation without credit
>-   changing any author's words slightly and presenting them as one's own
>-   turning in any assignment containing material written by someone else (including tutor or friend); buying work and submitting it as one's own

>  Know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it; for guidance see Raimes or any other college writing handbook. 


### Course Policy on Usage of AI Chatbots or Codelike ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, GitHub Copilot, etc. 

AI Chatbots can be helpful in learning. 

**AI Chatbots sometimes give inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, or outright false responses in an *extremely confident* tone, so use with caution and DO NOT BLINDLY TRUST THEM! In particular, because they by and large are roughly autocomplete on steroids, they generally struggle with arithmetic (surely they are getting better)** 


That being said, I allow their use in a limited and appropriate way - namely as a tool to help you learn. However they can also be used as a tool to avoid learning, to avoid engaging with the material, etc., and you are cheating yourself if you use tools this way. 

Here are some appropriate ways to use them:

- You can ask it to test your understanding of course material: e.g. ask it to make up quiz questions on concepts you just learned
- Ask it to explain something (e.g. a procedure such as the relationship between a linear transformation and a matrix)


**For this course, you must understand and be able to explain (at an appropriate level) anything you submit, whether the material is your own or you get it from classmate, internet, textbook, AI chatbots, etc.** 


## Accommodations for students with disabilities 

  
 If you have or suspect you may have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact Stacey DeFelice, Director, The Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (OSSD), NAB 2065, Phone: 516-628-5666, Email: defelices@oldwestbury.edu. The office will help you determine if you qualify for accommodations and assist you with the process of accessing them. All support services are free and all contacts with the OSSD are strictly confidential. SUNY Old Westbury is committed to assuring that all students have equal access to all learning activities and to social activities on campus.

## Title IX, Sexual discrimination, harassment, and violence
  

SUNY Old Westbury prohibits sexual discrimination, harassment and violence, and will promptly respond to all complaints.  The purpose of Title IX is to prevent sex discrimination on campus, address reported assaults and incidents, limit the effects of harassment on the educational environment, and prevent its recurrence.  If you or someone you know believes they have been subjected to sexual discrimination, harassment or violence, help is available. To report or for more information please visit https://www.oldwestbury.edu/title-ix, please contact the Title IX coordinator, Deputy Title IX coordinator or University Police at 516-876-3333. Confidential resources and support is also available from the counseling professionals in the Counseling and Psychological Wellness Services department, located in the Student Union Lower Level Room LL100 (off the Rotunda) at 516-876-3053.
