## Assignments/Grading

|               | Points  |
| -------------: | ------ |
| Participation | 40  |
| Week 1 Video  | 10  |
| Week 2 Video  | 10  |
| Week 3 Video  |10 |
| Week 4 Video  | 10|
| Final Exam |  20 | 


For various reasons, I have abandoned giving timed written exams, for better or worse. 

**Weekly Videos**
The best way to learn is to teach. At the end of each week, for weeks 1-4 (the course has 5 weeks), record a video 10-15 min instructional video, aimed towards your classmates, teaching them some things you learned.

**Participation**
You need to attend and be on task for all class sessions (but if there are one or two sessions you need to miss for legitimate reasons, that's fine, just email me beforehand). When I visit you in the individual breakout rooms, you should be able to share your screen and show me a reasonable attempt at engaging with the material.

**Final Exam**
One-on-one oral exam scheduled sometime during the last week

## Technology requirements
This course is taught remotely and synchronously via Zoom, and nothing beyond a typical internet-connected computer that is obviously required for any such a course is neccessary.  Specifically, you will need
 - some sort of computer (desktop, laptop) capable of running the following software:
- Zoom
- Python
- Visual Studio Code (or similar editor)
- reliable access to the internet (for synchronous Zoom sessions,  access to Google Colab)



## Academic Integrity

The college's policy on academic integrity also applies to this course
https://www.oldwestbury.edu/policies/academicresearch/policy-academic-integrity
Here are some excerpts from that policy:

>As members of the Old Westbury community, students are expected to adhere to standards of honesty and ethical behavior. Plagiarism and other types of academic dishonesty are condemned at all academic institutions. These acts detract from the student’s intellectual and personal growth by undermining the processes of higher learning and the struggle with one’s own expression of ideas and information.  Good academic procedure requires giving proper credit when using the words or ideas of others.

>Plagiarizing means “presenting somebody else’s words or ideas without acknowledging where those words and ideas come from” (Ann Raimes, Keys for Writers, 7th ed., p.135).  Examples include:
>-   copying material from the Internet or other sources and presenting it as one’s own
>-    using any author’s words without quotation marks; using any quotation without credit
>-   changing any author's words slightly and presenting them as one's own
>-   turning in any assignment containing material written by someone else (including tutor or friend); buying work and submitting it as one's own

>  Know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it; for guidance see Raimes or any other college writing handbook. 


### Course Policy on Usage of AI Chatbots or Codelike ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, GitHub Copilot, etc. 

AI Chatbots can be helpful in learning how to code. 

**AI Chatbots some times give inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, or outright false responses in an *extremely confident* tone, so use with caution and DO NOT BLINDLY TRUST THEM!** 


That being said, I allow their use in a limited and appropriate way - namely as a tool to help you learn. However they can also be used as a tool to avoid learning, to avoid engaging with the material, etc., and you are cheating yourself if you use tools this way. 

Here are some appropriate ways to use them:
-  if you can't resolve an error message, you can try asking an AI Chatbot to explain it
- You can ask it to test your understanding of course material: e.g. ask it to make up quiz questions on concepts you just learned
- Ask it to explain something (e.g. a procedure such as how to install Python or Visual Studio Code, or a concept such as 'for loops')


**For this course, you must understand and be able to explain (at an appropriate level) any code you submit, whether code is your own or you get it from classmate, internet, textbook, AI chatbots, etc.** 


## Accommodations for students with disabilities 

  
 If you have or suspect you may have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact Stacey DeFelice, Director, The Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (OSSD), NAB 2065, Phone: 516-628-5666, Email: defelices@oldwestbury.edu. The office will help you determine if you qualify for accommodations and assist you with the process of accessing them. All support services are free and all contacts with the OSSD are strictly confidential. SUNY Old Westbury is committed to assuring that all students have equal access to all learning activities and to social activities on campus.

## Title IX, Sexual discrimination, harassment, and violence
  

SUNY Old Westbury prohibits sexual discrimination, harassment and violence, and will promptly respond to all complaints.  The purpose of Title IX is to prevent sex discrimination on campus, address reported assaults and incidents, limit the effects of harassment on the educational environment, and prevent its recurrence.  If you or someone you know believes they have been subjected to sexual discrimination, harassment or violence, help is available. To report or for more information please visit https://www.oldwestbury.edu/title-ix, please contact the Title IX coordinator, Deputy Title IX coordinator or University Police at 516-876-3333. Confidential resources and support is also available from the counseling professionals in the Counseling and Psychological Wellness Services department, located in the Student Union Lower Level Room LL100 (off the Rotunda) at 516-876-3053.
